Description: An extension of Trellis Display that enables creation,
    organization, and interactive viewing of multi-panel displays created
    against potentially very large data sets.  The dynamic viewer tiles
    panels of a display across the screen in a web browser and allows the
    user to interactively page through the panels and sort and filter them
    based on "cognostic" metrics computed for each panel.  Panels can be
    created using many of R's plotting capabilities, including base R
    graphics, lattice, ggplot2, and many htmlwidgets.  Conditioning is
    handled through the datadr package, which enables Trelliscope displays
    with potentially millions of panels to be created against terabytes of
    data on systems like Hadoop.  While designed to scale, Trelliscope
    displays can also be very useful for small datasets.
