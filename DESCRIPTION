Description: Trelliscope provides a way to create, organize, and view
    multi-panel displays, a collection of which is called a visualization
    database (VDB).  This package provides a mechanism for extending the ideas
    of Trellis Display to easily generate and organize plots, providing a
    dynamic viewer for tiling panels of a display across the screen and paging
    through them. There is also a mechanism to generate built-in or
    user-defined "cognostic" metrics for each panel of a display , and the
    viewer has the ability to sort or filter the pages based on these
    cognostics.  This is useful for large multi-panel displays where it is not
    possible to view each panel, allowing only panels with interesting features
    to be presented.  This package also provides a way to meaningfully organize
    and present these displays in a "lab notebook".
